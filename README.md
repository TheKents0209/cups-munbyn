# cups-munbyn
An Unraid Docker container by Florian Schwab with added support for Munbyn/Rollo thermal printers

This is just a copy of ydkn/cups docker container from Unraids app store, all credit goes to him.. I've just added a Rollo ubuntu driver installer (works with Munbyn aswell), rastertolabelbeeprt (instructions basically for the printer, credits go to [https://forum.manjaro.org/t/munbyn-itpp941-stopped-no-available-printer/114284](him)) and also a .ppd file that is also from him.

Currently 4x6 labels print about 15% too high but I'll try to fix that asap.
